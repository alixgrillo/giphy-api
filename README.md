## About
The animal GIF page allows the user to see 10 randoms GIFs (hard-G) of their favorite animals. The search
is based on the text on the buttons. When the page loads, there will be 8 buttons to start, and the user can 
click any of the button to render the GIFs.

## Functionality
Once the GIFs load, they will all be still images. To animate the images, click on any of images, and they 
will animate. By click on the image again, it will return to the still state. Go ahead and animate all of the
images at once!

Add a new word by using the form and clicking the Add! button. A new button will appears and it will pull in 
GIFs for the new search term.

If you don't like any of the search terms, you can delete a button by hovering over the button and clicking
the black X close button that generates. Take note that the parent button with the search term will not 
activate the GIFs when the close button is clicked.
